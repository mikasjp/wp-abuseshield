# WP AbuseShield
WP AbuseShield is a WordPress plugin that helps protect your valuable website against many types of abuse on the Internet.

## How does it work?
The idea is very simple. The plugin checks the IP address of the new user in the AbuseIPDB via the API and checks if it has been reported in the last seven days. If IP is reported to AbuseIPDB, access is denied, otherwise access is granted.
